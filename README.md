Web app for software dev 2

<b>Inspiration</b>

In the movie where "What would you could told yourself in the future, so you won't have regret?" scenario, in this era 
we won't be digging up a box containing message written by past self anymore or write a letter and sent all around 
in circle and coincidently arrive at yourself at right moment. Instead we have an E-mail service which every people 
should have at least one address. We are implementing this idea right into this program.

<b>Functionalities</b>

This program function as letter delivery messenger, which store user's data and sent in form of letter.
What's more is we can timed the message, currently we have no limit on how far it can be timed.
Here's what we have covered so far
-Write and Sent the letter(message). 
-The message that has been sent CANNOT be view, untill you recieved it. (This is intentional)
-Registration and Login use authentication.
-still continued...

<b>What we intended to do</b>

We aim to create not just "usable" but also "practitional" program.
There's a lot of works to do so stay tuned!

We use Python and Django web framework.
